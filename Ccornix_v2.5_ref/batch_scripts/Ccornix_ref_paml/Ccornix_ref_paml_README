Pipeline for obtaining gene sequences using Ccornix reference annotation.

1) Move to the batch scripts directory. This will ensure logs are saved in this directory.

$ cd /proj/b2013182/nobackup/batch_scripts/Ccornix_ref_genomecov_masking/

2) Run the extracting scripts for each species

# 3sp_Ccornix
$ sbatch Ccornix_ref_extract_genes.bsh 3sp_Ccornix
