Crow bioinformatic pipeline:
Reference genome: Ccornix v2.5

1) Mapping
Software:
BWA v0.7.12 mem

see batch script: 

/proj/b2013182/nobackup/batch_scripts/mapping/All_mapping_JAN16_Ccornix.bsh

Notes:
This step maps the reads from each sample of each individual from each species to the Ccornix reference genome.
This step also removes duplicate reads/alignments from the resulting .bam files but keeps a set of .bam files that
still contains them.

2) Consensus genome building
Software:
samtools v0.1.9 mpileup
bcftools v1.2
vcftools v0.1.14

see batch script: 

/proj/b2013182/nobackup/batch_scripts/Ccornix_ref_consensus_mpileup/mpileup_consensus.bsh

Notes:
This step makes a .vcf and a .fq file that represents the consensus genome for each species mapped to the Ccornix 
reference genome. Each consensus genome should be the same length as the reference.

3) Merging
Software:
bamtools v2.3.0
samtools v0.1.9

see batch script:

/proj/b2013182/nobackup/batch_scripts/Ccornix_ref_merge_bams/merge_bams.bsh

Notes:
This step merges all .bam files for a species into one.

4) Genome coverage and Masking
Software:
bedtools v2.25.0

see batch script:

/proj/b2013182/nobackup/batch_scripts/Ccornix_ref_genomecov_masking/.bsh

Notes:
This step calculates coverage for each position in the genome based on the merged .bam files for each species.
Then each position in the consensus genome where coverage is <= 5 is replaced with "N"


6) Obtaining orthologs
Software:
gffread


Notes:
This step extracts the spliced CDS from each consesnsus genome based on the Ccornix annotation.
Mitochondrial genome removed from analysis at this stage due to issues with the NCBI annotation.
Annotation file modified to remove all mitochondrial gene entries.

7) Gene Completeness
Software:
fastaStats.py

Notes:
This step assesses the "completeness" of each gene model that is recovered from the re-sequenced species. This includes 
presence/absence determination.
